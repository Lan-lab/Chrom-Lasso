C++ implementation of the Iteratively Re-Weighted Least Squares algorithm (IRLS)
 for generalized linear models (GLM)

** Install and usage
prerequisite: GNU Scientific Library (GSL) and C++ compiler (for instance g++)

To test, run `R --vanilla < test.R`. This will:
- simulate data;
- run the built-in glm() function (output shown on stdout);
- save data in files (test_y.dat, test_X.dat and test_offset.dat);
- compile c++ code (test.cpp) and run IRLS (output also shown on stdout).


** Extension to other GLM

To add a new link function, create a class mimicking "LogLink".
The new class should inherit from "LinkFunc" (base class) and
implement all required methods.
